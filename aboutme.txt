Hi, my name is John Carlo L. Lipa. I graduated with a degree in Secondary Education.

I love coding during my vacant hour. I also love to write poems and read books. My favorite movie is The Godfather.

My plan is to become a software engineer and to become a blockchain developer for the next 5 years.
